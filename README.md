We recommend the following resources:
– https://www.python.org
– https://docs.scipy.org/doc/
– http://matplotlib.org
– https://github.com/sintefmath/Splipy
– http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/files/reading-and-writing-files-in-python

• Start as simple as possible. Do one thing at the time and verify that it is correct
before proceeding. Compare with hand calculations on simple problems, if you find
this easier. It is recommended to construct small reference problems and test them
to ensure that the code is correct.

• You should hand in a written answer to all the questions in LaTeX. It is sufficient to
just answer the questions with properly discussion, which will be the main emphasis.
Do not write a traditional report. Source code should not be contained in the report.

• It is important to obtain the correct results and discuss them. If you use other sources
than the text book or lecture notes, which is strongly recommended, remember to
always cite them.

• A well-documented and self-contained code satisfies the following criterions:
– It includes sufficient information to make it clear for the user what the program
does, and how to use it.
– It executes and provides expected results without any problems. In particular
this means that all submodules you write must be included in this file.

• There will be much emphasis on running time. When you are sure that the program
is 100% correct, examine whether the speed is optimal.
